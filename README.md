This is the second time my iCloud Bookmarks recycle bin has overfilled from a bookmark sync circle. Basically having many devices with Edge/FireFox/Chrome/Safari and the delete files sync back after been deleted from another device. This could simply be done by using iCloud for Windows and adding a browser with 10,000s of bookmarks. Each time you delete in an iOS/macOS it takes 30 days to clear the iCloud bin. If it overfills - iCloud bookmarks stops working.

I've previously had better success with <something else> which I have forgotten. It could have been in the Developer Tools, or on any OS or browser. This way here works, though it does need to be checked up on incase the browser has a memory error.
